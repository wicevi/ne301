/**
 * @file upload_coordinator.h
 * @brief Capture-record persistence, mode dispatch, retry, and cleanup.
 *
 * Owns the on-disk /captures/ tree (pending/sent/failed/local/data subdirs) on
 * whichever filesystem the user has chosen (auto/flash/sd/none). After a
 * capture completes the system_service hands the JPEG buffer here; the
 * coordinator persists it, attaches metadata, and dispatches according to
 * capture_upload_config_t.mode:
 *
 *   INSTANT     - Upload synchronously inside enqueue_capture(); on failure,
 *                 the record stays in pending/ for retry. With storage=NONE,
 *                 nothing is persisted and failure is final.
 *   BATCH       - Persist only; flush is triggered when pending_count reaches
 *                 batch_count, or on the next wake_scheduler tick.
 *   SCHEDULED   - Persist only; flush is triggered by wake_scheduler at the
 *                 configured minutes-of-day.
 *   LOCAL_ONLY  - Persist into local/ and never upload.
