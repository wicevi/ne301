/**
 * @file wake_scheduler.h
 * @brief Unified next-wake / due-event lookup over capture and upload schedules.
 *
 * Two time-tables feed into one merged view:
 *   - timer_trigger      (work_mode_config_t.timer_trigger)        -> WAKE_DUTY_CAPTURE
 *   - capture upload     (capture_upload_config_t.schedule_minutes) -> WAKE_DUTY_UPLOAD_FLUSH
 *
 * Used in two places:
 *   - Before sleep: compute the minimum sleep_second so U0 wakes us at the
 *     next event. No "intent" is sent to U0 — semantic is recovered on wake.
 *   - On wake (RTC): look up which duties fall in [now-tolerance, now+tolerance]
 *     and execute them. NVS-backed last_handled_at prevents double-fire.
